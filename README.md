# Line Integral Convolution

Line Integral Convolutions (LICs) are an amazing way to visualise 2D vector fields, and are widely used in many different fields (e.g., weather modelling, plasma physics, etc.), however I couldn't find a simple, up-to-date implementation, so I wrote my own. I hope it can now also help you on your own vector field fueled journey!

Here is an example of the LIC code applied to two different vector fields:
- Left: modified Lotka-Volterra equations
- Right: Gaussian random vector field

## Getting setup

You can now install the LIC package directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/line-integral-convolutions/) or clone the [Github](https://github.com/AstroKriel/LineIntegralConvolutions/) repository if you'd like to play around with the source code.

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (for general use)

If you only need to use the package, you can install it via `pip`:

```bash
pip install vegtamr
```

After installing, import the main LIC implementation as follows:

```bash
from vegtamr import lic
```

Inside this module, you will want to use the `compute_lic_with_postprocessing` function. See below for details on how to get the most out of it.

### Option 2: Clone the GitHub repository (for development)

#### 1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AstroKriel/LineIntegralConvolutions.git
cd LineIntegralConvolutions
```

#### 2. Create a development environment with uv:

```bash
uv sync
```

This will install dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml` into a virtual environment managed by `uv`.

With `uv` you get clean package management and reproducibility, where the only trade-off is a few extra keystrokes when running scripts:

```bash
uv run playground/main-script.py
```

A small price to pay for sanity! Alternatively, you can activate the environment with source `.venv/bin/activate` and run `python3 playground/main-script.py`.

#### 3. Editable install (optional):

If you’d like to make changes to the code and have them reflected immediately (for example, when importing `vegtamr` into other projects), run:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

This will install the package in "editable" mode, allowing you to edit the code and have the changes reflected without needing to reinstall the package each time.

## Quick start

`compute_lic_with_postprocessing` is the main entry point for generating Line Integral Convolutions. It manages all the internal calls and offers optional postprocessing: filtering and intensity equalisation. In practice, this is the only function you’ll need to call!

Here’s a quick example:


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as mpl_plot
from vegtamr.lic import compute_lic_with_postprocessing
from vegtamr.utils import vfields, plots

## generate a sample vector field
num_pixels   = 500
dict_field   = vfields.vfield_swirls(num_pixels)
vfield       = dict_field["vfield"]
streamlength = dict_field["streamlength"]
bounds_rows  = dict_field["bounds_rows"]
bounds_cols  = dict_field["bounds_cols"]

## apply the lic
sfield = compute_lic_with_postprocessing(
    vfield         = vfield,
    streamlength   = streamlength,      # brush stroke length
    num_lic_passes = 3,                 # number of brush strokes
    use_filter     = True,
    filter_sigma   = 5e-2 * num_pixels, # tube thickness
    use_equalize   = True,
    backend        = "rust",
)

## and now plot!
fig, ax = mpl_plot.subplots()
plots.plot_lic(
    ax=ax,
    sfield=sfield,
    vfield=vfield,
    cmap_name="pink",
)
mpl_plot.show()
```

There are a number of parameters for you to experiment with; the effect of some choices is demonstrated by `playground/demo_effect_of_params.py`, which produces the following image:

<img src="./gallery/effect_of_params.png" width="100%" />

In practice you will want to choose a `streamlength` close to the correlation length (in cells) of the structures you are trying to highlight. Depending on the effect you're aiming for, you can also play around with turning on the highpass filter (`use_filter`), changing its size (`filter_sigma`; controls the thickness of tubes), and turning on intensity equalization (`use_equalize`).

## Acknowledgements

The fast (pre-compiled Rust) backend option, which this repo uses by default, was implemented by Dr. Clément Robert ([@neutrinoceros](https://github.com/neutrinoceros); see [rLIC](https://github.com/neutrinoceros/rLIC)). Special thanks also go to Dr. James Beattie ([@AstroJames](https://github.com/AstroJames)) for highlighting how iteration, high-pass filtering, and histogram normalisation improve the final result. Finally, Dr. Philip Mocz ([@pmocz](https://github.com/pmocz)) provided lots of helpful suggestions in restructuring and improving the codebase.
